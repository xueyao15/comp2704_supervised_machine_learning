## **NHL Player Salary Prediction Project**

NHL player salary prediction using decision tree and svm (regression).

During the initial stages of the project (initial_project.ipynb), I found some intriguing findings just by analyzing the dataset from the 2016/17 season. As the project progressed (final_project.ipynb), I compared the performance of the best decision tree model and the best SVM model. Ultimately, the best final model was able to explainÂ 65% of the variance in salaries.

Upon analyzing the decision tree (dt.ipynb) and support vector machine (svm.ipynb) files, I discovered that several features were especially important in predicting the players' salaries. 

The model may be useful for teams and managers when making data-driven decisions about player contracts and salaries.
